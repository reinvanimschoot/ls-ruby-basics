In an earlier exercise, you wrote a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until a certain number of lines have been printed. Our solution looked like this:

number_of_lines = nil
loop do
  puts '>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:'
  number_of_lines = gets.to_i
  break if number_of_lines >= 3
  puts ">> That's not enough lines."
end

while number_of_lines > 0
  puts 'Launch School is the best!'
  number_of_lines -= 1
end

Modify this program so it repeats itself after each input/print iteration, asking for a new number each time through. The program should keep running until the user enters q or Q.

Examples:

$ ruby lsprint2.rb
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
5
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
2
>> That's not enough lines.
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
3
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
Launch School is the best!
>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3 (Q to quit):
q

=end

# Answer:

loop do
  puts ">> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >=3: (Q to quit)"

  input = gets.chomp

  break if input.downcase == "q"

  number_of_lines = input.to_i

  if number_of_lines < 3
    puts ">> That's not enough lines."
    next
  end

  number_of_lines.times do
    puts "Launch school is the best!"
  end
end
